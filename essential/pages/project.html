<h2>Final Project</h2>
<p class="page-text">
	My supreme, magnificent best friend and sister-from-another-mister <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/demaior">Rose</a> and I will be creating an application called Lunchbox that allows users to log in, search for, and save their favorite recipes. Users can also review recipes and follow other users. We are using the Yummly API and the MEAN stack to build this app. Check out the <a href="http://lunchbox-rosedemaio.rhcloud.com/index.html">site</a> and our <a href="https://github.com/rosedemaio/lunchbox">Git repo.</a>
